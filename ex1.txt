### 1. What is a simple graph?  
    A simple graph has no self referencing edges, i.e. V = {v1, v2.. }
    there does not exist an edge such that the set of edges E does not contain
    an edge such as (v1, v1), (v2, v2) etc..


### 2. What is a regular graph?  What is a complete graph?  Prove that a 
   ### complete graph is regular.
    a regular graph is a graph such that each vertex has the same degree.
    A complete graph is a graph where each pair of vertices has an edge
        connecting them. proof is in my notebook.

### 3. What is a path?  What is a cycle?
       a path is a sequence of edges that connect a sequence of vertices.j
       a cycle is a sequnce of edges that connects a sequnce of vertices
           starting and ending at the same vertex.

### 4. What is a forest? What is a tree?  
       a forest is a disjoint union of trees.  This means that it is a set
       of trees that are not connected by any edges.  A tree is an undirected
       graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.  In
       other words, any connected graph without any simple cycles is a tree.
